Supply and Demand Accounting
============================

Regression models of real estate prices don't account for
supply and demand affects. The ``supplydemand`` module has models that
work in tandem with :ref:`location choice models <statistical-models>`
to estimate supply and demand and adjust real estate prices
to compensate for mismatches.

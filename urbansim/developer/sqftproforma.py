class SqFtProFormaConfig(object):
    """
    This class encapsulates the configuration options for the square
    foot based pro forma.

    parcel_sizes : list
        A list of parcel sizes to test.  Interestingly, right now
        the parcel sizes cancel in this style of pro forma computation so
        you can set this to something reasonable for debugging purposes -
        e.g. [10000].  All sizes can be feet or meters as long as they are
        consistently used.
    fars : list
        A list of floor area ratios to use.  FAR is a multiple of
        the parcel size that is the total building bulk that is allowed by
        zoning on the site.  In this case, all of these ratios will be
        tested regardless of zoning and the zoning test will be performed
        later.
    uses : list
        A list of space uses to use within a building.  These are
        mixed into forms.  Generally speaking, you should only have uses
        for which you have an estimate (or observed) values for rents in
        the building.  By default, uses are retail, industrial, office,
        and residential.
    forms : dict
        A dictionary where keys are names for the form and values
        are also dictionaries where keys are uses and values are the
        proportion of that use used in this form.  The values of the
        dictionary should sum to 1.0.  For instance, a form called
        "residential" might have a dict of space allocations equal to
        {"residential": 1.0} while a form called "mixedresidential"
        might have a dictionary of space allocations equal to
        {"retail": .1, "residential" .9] which is 90% residential and
        10% retail.
    parking_rates : dict
        A dict of rates per thousand square feet where keys are the uses
        from the list specified in the attribute above.  The ratios
        are typically in the range 0.5 - 3.0 or similar.  So for
        instance, a key-value pair of "retail": 2.0 would be two parking
        spaces per 1,000 square feet of retail.  This is a per square
        foot pro forma, so the more typically parking ratio of spaces
        per residential unit must be converted to square feet for use in
        this pro forma.
    sqft_per_rate : float
        The number of square feet per unit for use in the
        parking_rates above.  By default this is set to 1,000 but can be
        overridden.
    parking_configs : list
        An expert parameter and is usually unchanged.  By default
        it is set to ['surface', 'deck', 'underground'] and very semantic
        differences in the computation are performed for each of these
        parking configurations.  Generally speaking it will break things
        to change this array, but an item can be removed if that parking
        configuration should not be tested.
    parking_sqft_d : dict
        A dictionary where keys are the three parking
        configurations listed above and values are square foot uses of
        parking spaces in that configuration.  This is to capture the
        fact that surface parking is usually more space intensive
        than deck or underground parking.
    parking_cost_d : dict
        The parking cost for each parking configuration.  Keys are the
        name of the three parking configurations listed above and values
        are dollars PER SQUARE FOOT for parking in that configuration.
        Used to capture the fact that underground and deck are far more
        expensive than surface parking.
    height_for_costs : list
        A list of "break points" as heights at which construction becomes
        more expensive.  Generally these are the heights at which
        construction materials change from wood, to concrete, to steel.
        Costs are also given as lists by use for each of these break
        points and are considered to be valid up to the break point.  A
        list would look something like [15, 55, 120, np.inf].
    costs : dict
        The keys are uses from the attribute above and the values are a
        list of floating point numbers of same length as the
        height_for_costs attribute.  A key-value pair of
        "residential": [160.0, 175.0, 200.0, 230.0] would say that the
        residential use if $160/sqft up to 15ft in total height for the
        building, $175/sqft up to 55ft, $200/sqft up to 120ft, and
        $230/sqft beyond.  A final value in the height_for_costs
        array of np.inf is typical.
    height_per_story : float
        The per-story height for the building used to turn an
        FAR into an actual height.
    max_retail_height : float
        The maximum height of retail buildings to consider.
    max_industrial_height : float
        The maximum height of industrial buildings to consider.
    profit_factor : float
        The ratio of profit a developer expects to make above the break
        even rent.  Should be greater than 1.0, e.g. a 10% profit would be
        a profit factor of 1.1.
    building_efficiency : float
        The efficiency of the building.  This turns total FAR into the
        amount of space which gets a square foot rent.  The entire building
        gets the cost of course.
    parcel_coverage : float
        The ratio of the building footprint to the parcel size.  Also used
        to turn an FAR into a height to cost properly.
    cap_rate : float
        The rate an investor is willing to pay for a cash flow per year.
        This means $1/year is equivalent to 1/cap_rate present dollars.
        This is a macroeconomic input that is widely available on the
        internet.

class SqFtProForma(object):

    Initialize the square foot based pro forma.

    This pro forma has no representation of units - it does not
    differentiate between the rent attained by 1BR, 2BR, or 3BR and change
    the rents accordingly.  This is largely because it is difficult to get
    information on the unit mix in an existing building in order to compute
    its acquisition cost.  Thus rents and costs per sqft are used for new
    and current buildings which assumes there is a constant return on
    increasing and decreasing unit sizes, an extremely useful simplifying
    assumption above the project scale (i.e. city of regional scale)

        This function does the developer model lookups for all the actual input data.

        Parameters
        ----------
        form : string
            One of the forms specified in the configuration file
        df: dataframe
            Pass in a single data frame which is indexed by parcel_id and has the
            following columns
        only_built : bool
            Whether to return only those buildings that are profitable and allowed
            by zoning, or whether to return as much information as possible, even if
            unlikely to be built (can be used when development might be subsidized
            or when debugging)
        pass_through : list of strings
            List of field names to take from the input parcel frame and pass
            to the output feasibility frame - is usually used for debugging
            purposes - these fields will be passed all the way through
            developer

        Input Dataframe Columns
        rent : dataframe
            A set of columns, one for each of the uses passed in the configuration.
            Values are yearly rents for that use.  Typical column names would be
            "residential", "retail", "industrial" and "office"
        land_cost : series
            A series representing the CURRENT yearly rent for each parcel.  Used to
            compute acquisition costs for the parcel.
        parcel_size : series
            A series representing the parcel size for each parcel.
        max_far : series
            A series representing the maximum far allowed by zoning.  Buildings
            will not be built above these fars.
        max_height : series
            A series representing the maxmium height allowed by zoning.  Buildings
            will not be built above these heights.  Will pick between the min of
            the far and height, will ignore on of them if one is nan, but will not
            build if both are nan.
        max_dua : series, optional
            A series representing the maximum dwelling units per acre allowed by
            zoning.  If max_dua is passed, the average unit size should be passed
            below to translate from dua to floor space.
        ave_unit_size : series, optional
            This is required if max_dua is passed above, otherwise it is optional.
            This is the same as the parameter to Developer.pick() (it should be the
            same series).

        Returns
        -------
        index : Series, int
            parcel identifiers
        building_sqft : Series, float
            The number of square feet for the building to build.  Keep in mind
            this includes parking and common space.  Will need a helpful function
            to convert from gross square feet to actual usable square feet in
            residential units.
        building_cost : Series, float
            The cost of constructing the building as given by the
            ave_cost_per_sqft from the cost model (for this FAR) and the number
            of square feet.
        total_cost : Series, float
            The cost of constructing the building plus the cost of acquisition of
            the current parcel/building.
        building_revenue : Series, float
            The NPV of the revenue for the building to be built, which is the
            number of square feet times the yearly rent divided by the cap
            rate (with a few adjustment factors including building efficiency).
        max_profit_far : Series, float
            The FAR of the maximum profit building (constrained by the max_far and
            max_height from the input dataframe).
        max_profit :
            The profit for the maximum profit building (constrained by the max_far
            and max_height from the input dataframe).

        Choose the buildings from the list that are feasible to build in

        Parameters
        ----------
        form : string or list
            One or more of the building forms from the pro forma specification -
            e.g. "residential" or "mixedresidential" - these are configuration
            parameters passed previously to the pro forma.  If more than one form
            is passed the forms compete with each other (based on profitability)
            for which one gets built in order to meet demand.
        target_units : int
            The number of units to build.  For non-residential buildings this
            should be passed as the number of job spaces that need to be created.
        parcel_size : series
            The size of the parcels.  This was passed to feasibility as well,
            but should be passed here as well.  Index should be parcel_ids.
        ave_unit_size : series
            The average residential unit size around each parcel - this is
            indexed by parcel, but is usually a disaggregated version of a
            zonal or accessibility aggregation.
        bldg_sqft_per_job : float (default 400.0)
            The average square feet per job for this building form.
        min_unit_size : float
            Values less than this number in ave_unit_size will be set to this
            number.  Deals with cases where units are currently not built.
        current_units : series
            The current number of units on the parcel.  Is used to compute the
            net number of units produced by the developer model.  Many times
            the developer model is redeveloping units (demolishing them) and
            is trying to meet a total number of net units produced.
        max_parcel_size : float
            Parcels larger than this size will not be considered for
            development - usually large parcels should be specified manually
            in a development projects table.
        drop_after_build : bool
            Whether or not to drop parcels from consideration after they
            have been chosen for development.  Usually this is true so as
            to not develop the same parcel twice.
        residential: bool
            If creating non-residential buildings set this to false and
            developer will fill in job_spaces rather than residential_units

        -------
